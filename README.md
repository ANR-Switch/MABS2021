# MABS 2021: Exploration of model coupling strategies in a hybrid agent-based traffic simulation
IDM and Event-Driven Queue-Based coupling. Studies the impact of coupling different models of traffic simulation within an agent-based framework

## Based on
 - Derbel and al. - Modified Intelligent Driver Model for Driver Safety and Traffic Stability Improvement
 - Treiber and al. - Car-Following Models Based on Driving Strategies
 - Charypar and al. - Event-Driven Queue-Based Traffic Flow Microsimulation
 - Zilske and al. - OpenStreetMap For Traffic Simulation

## Implemented in GAMA
 - Taillandier and al. - Building, composing and experimenting complex spatial models with the GAMA platform
